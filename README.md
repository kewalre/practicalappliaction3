Comparing Classifiers using different Models

Executive Summary:
This assignment involves around comparing different classification models and evaluating their accuracy, performance and time execution. The Bank dataset is used to determine how many customers will open a term Deposit. 

Model Performance:
There were 4 Models used to fit the data after data clean-up and Feature engineering without any hyper parameter tuning. The Models performed as listed in the table below:

Model Accuracy , score and time results without optimization
                    Model  Accuracy  Precision    Recall  F1-score  \
0      LogisticRegression  0.785714   0.750000  0.705882  0.784568   
1     K-Nearest Neighbors  0.642857   0.550000  0.647059  0.645938   
2           Decision Tree  0.666667   0.565217  0.764706  0.668939   
3  Support Vector Machine  0.666667   0.636364  0.411765  0.648810   

   Train Time  Inference Time  
0    0.025053        0.002458  
1    0.004773        0.011825  
2    0.011355        0.002407  
3    0.007181        0.002867  

After boosting the hyperparameters and using GridCV search, the model performance stands slightly changed as shown below. Hyper parameter tuning and Gridcv search didnâ€™t boost the performance much.

Model Accuracy , score and time results with optimization
                    Model  Accuracy  Precision    Recall  F1-score  \
0      LogisticRegression  0.714286   0.619048  0.764706  0.716901
